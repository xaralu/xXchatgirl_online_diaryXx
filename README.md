xXchatgirl_online_diaryXx is a project pioneered by Xara Alexander, with the goal of creating an online persona that functions as an expression of the artist's identity and allows them to explore their and other's interactions under anonymity in chatroom spaces. 

Hopefully, this project will inspire people to talk about sexuality and identity in virtual spaces, and bring pleasure from the act of participation in this benign social experiment.
