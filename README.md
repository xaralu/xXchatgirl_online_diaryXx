xXchatgirl_online_diaryXx is a project pioneered by Xara Alexander, with the goal of creating an online persona that functions as an expression of the artist's identity and allows them to explore their and other's interactions under anonymity in chatroom spaces. 

Hopefully, this project will inspire people to talk about sexuality and identity in virtual spaces, and bring pleasure from the act of participation in this benign social experiment.

Details: The point of the project is to create a persona that the artist will act through on chatrooms, and record meaningful interactions and significant moments with other virtual identities online. The time of day online will be adjusted as the project goes on, as well as the username, depending on the experience in the chatroom. 
Inspired by the Melissa Gronlund's essay Narcissism to the Dialogic: Identity in Art after the Internet.
